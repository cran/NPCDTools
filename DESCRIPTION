Description: Statistical tools for analyzing cognitive diagnosis (CD) data collected from small settings using the nonparametric classification (NPCD) framework. The core methods of the NPCD framework includes the nonparametric classification (NPC) method developed by Chiu and Douglas (2013) <DOI:10.1007/s00357-013-9132-9> and the general NPC (GNPC) method developed by Chiu, Sun, and Bian (2018) <DOI:10.1007/s11336-017-9595-4> and Chiu and KÃ¶hn (2019) <DOI:10.1007/s11336-019-09660-x>. An extension of the NPCD framework included in the package is the nonparametric method for multiple-choice items (MC-NPC) developed by Wang, Chiu, and Koehn (2023) <DOI:10.3102/10769986221133088>.  Functions associated with various extensions concerning the evaluation, validation, and feasibility of the CD analysis are also provided. These topics include the completeness of Q-matrix, Q-matrix refinement method, as well as Q-matrix estimation.
